## What is map matching?

--

#### It's the process of matching noisy GPS data to the most probable travel route.

--

```{r title-cover-closeup, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "title-cover-closeup.png"))
```

## Who are interested in map matching and why?

--

#### Not surprisingly, anybody who deals with GPS data!

--

- **Auto insurance companies**: Crash risk assessment (e.g., Are drivers often driving through high crash risk roads? Do we need to adjust premiums?)

--

- **Highway agencies**: Streamline winter maintenance efforts (e.g., Are snowplows serving the same route multiple times? Can they be directed somewhere else?)

--

- **Transportation researchers**: Travel pattern analyses (e.g., Do older drivers with cognition and/or vision problem(s) prefer one route over another?)
